This paper empirically investigates the joint impact of different types of globalization and financial development on income inequality. Using a fixed effects panel data model with data for 22 Asian countries from 2007 to 2019, we show that the influence of globalization on income inequality is lessened when financial development takes place. Our initial model demonstrates the combined impact of trade globalization and financial development significantly and negatively affects income inequality. Similarly, our second model estimates that technological globalization combined with financial development also significantly and negatively affects income inequality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that financial development can mitigate the effect of financial globalization on income disparity. Additionally our findings show that while urbanization exacerbates income inequality, GDP per capita appears to mitigate the inequality impact.

Trade liberalization, which involves reducing or removing barriers such as tariffs and quotas to promote free trade, has a mixed impact on Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India. Increased foreign competition drives efficiency and cheaper production among domestic firms, potentially benefiting industries with competitive advantages. However, it can also negatively impact businesses that struggle to compete with foreign producers. Our study finds that trade liberalization in India is linked to improved Gross Value of Output (GVO) growth among MSMEs, but it has a relatively insignificant impact on firm-level productivity. The benefits of trade liberalization are primarily realized by MSMEs that are technologically upgraded and quality certified. Additionally, the gains from sourcing imported inputs following input tariff reductions are greater than those from increased product competition following reductions in final good tariffs.
